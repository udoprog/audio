//!
//! A single-threaded executor with some tricks up its sleeve.
//!
//! This was primarily written for use in [audio] as a low-latency way of
//! interacting with a single background thread for audio-related purposes, but
//! is otherwise a general purpose library that can be used to do anything.
//!
//! > **Soundness Warning:** This crate uses a fair bit of **unsafe**. Some of
//! > the tricks employed needs to be rigirously sanity checked for safety
//! > before you can rely on this for production uses.
//!
//! The default way to access the underlying thread is through the [submit]
//! method. This blocks the current thread for the duration of the task allowing
//! the background thread to access variables which are in scope. Like `n`
//! below.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//! let thread = ste::spawn();
//!
//! let mut n = 10;
//! thread.submit(|| n += 10);
//! assert_eq!(20, n);
//!
//! thread.join();
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Restricting thread access using tags
//!
//! This library provides the ability to construct a [Tag] which is uniquely
//! associated with the thread that created it. This can then be used to ensure
//! that data is only accessible by one thread.
//!
//! This is useful, because many APIs requires *thread-locality* where instances
//! can only safely be used by the thread that created them. This is a low-level
//! tool we provide which allows the safe implementation of `Send` for types
//! which are otherwise `!Send`.
//!
//! Note that correctly using a [Tag] is hard, and incorrect use has severe
//! safety implications. Make sure to study its documentation closely before
//! use.
//!
//! ```rust
//! struct Foo {
//!     tag: ste::Tag,
//! }
//!
//! impl Foo {
//!     fn new() -> Self {
//!         Self {
//!             tag: ste::Tag::current_thread(),
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     fn say_hello(&self) {
//!         self.tag.ensure_on_thread();
//!         println!("Hello World!");
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! # fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//! let thread = ste::spawn();
//!
//! let foo = thread.submit(|| Foo::new());
//!
//! thread.submit(|| {
//!     foo.say_hello(); // <- OK!
//! });
//!
//! thread.join();
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! Using `say_hello` outside of the thread that created it is not fine and will
//! panic to prevent racy access:
//!
//! ```rust,should_panic
//! # struct Foo { tag: ste::Tag }
//! # impl Foo {
//! #     fn new() -> Self { Self { tag: ste::Tag::current_thread() } }
//! #     fn say_hello(&self) { self.tag.ensure_on_thread(); }
//! # }
//! # fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//! let thread = ste::spawn();
//!
//! let foo = thread.submit(|| Foo::new());
//!
//! foo.say_hello(); // <- Oops, panics!
//!
//! thread.join();
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Known unsafety and soundness issues
//!
//! Below you can find a list of unsafe use and known soundness issues this
//! library currently has. The soundness issues **must be fixed** before this
//! library goes out of *alpha*.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ### Pointers to stack-local addresses
//!
//! In order to efficiently share data between a thread calling [submit] and the
//! background thread, the background thread references a fair bit of
//! stack-local data from the calling thread which involves a fair bit of
//! `unsafe`.
//!
//! While it should be possible to make this use *safe* (as is the hope of this
//! library), it carries a risk that if the background thread were to proceed
//! executing a task that is no longer synchronized properly with a caller of
//! [submit] it might end up referencing data which is either no longer valid
//! (use after free), or contains something else (dirty).
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ### Tag re-use
//!
//! [Tag] containers currently use a tag based on the address of a slab of
//! allocated memory that is associated with each [Thread]. If however a
//! [Thread] is shut down, and a new later recreated, there is a slight risk
//! that this might re-use an existing memory address.
//!
//! Memory addresses are quite thankful to use, because they're cheap and quite
//! easy to access. Due to this it might however be desirable to use a generated
//! ID per thread instead which can for example abort a program in case it can't
//! guarantee uniqueness.
