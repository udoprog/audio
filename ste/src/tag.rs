/// A tag associated with a thread. Threads which are executed with

///
/// You must ensure that any thread trying to use values first is checked with
/// the current tag through [Tag::ensure_on_thread]. This includes everything
/// which poses a potential thread safety risk.
///
/// This includes, but is not limited to:
/// * Accessing or mutating any racy data or APIs, such as `Cell<T>`.
/// * The type that is tagged, (and any nested types) [drop][Drop::drop]
///   implementation.
///
/// If all of the above is satifised, you can safely implement [Send] and [Sync]
/// for the type. Make sure to include a comprehensive safety message such as:
///
/// ```
/// # struct Foo;
/// // Safety: the structure is explicitly tagged with the thread that created
/// // it, and we ensure everywhere (including drop implementations) where racy
/// // access might occur that it is on the thread that created it.
/// unsafe impl Send for Foo {}
/// ```
///
/// Tags can only be correctly constructed in two ways:
/// * By calling [Tag::current_thread] if inside of a thread context. Such as
///   [Thread::submit][super::Thread::submit] or
///   [Thread::submit_async][super::Thread::submit_async].
/// * Externally by calling [Thread::tag][super::Thread::tag].
///
